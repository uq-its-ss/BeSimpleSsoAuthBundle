SSO authentication for Symfony3
===============================


This bundle helps you to bring SSO authentication to your Symfony2 project.


It works in two ways:

-   **trusted**: authentication is done against a known server (like with CAS)
-   **open**: authentication is done with server of user's choice (like with OpenId)


Only CAS protocol is implemented for now, many other are planned.

Support for SAML protocol is implemented.
